Getting_Cleaning
================

This repository is for Getting-Cleaning course project.

If you really want to run the script, everything is simple: download it to the directory with the dataset ('UCI...' whatever it goes there), and plug the script into RStudio.

The working directory should be the same as the script's one. Yes, I know that it would be better to implement various check, download data if it's absent etcetera, but I'm on my vacation at the seaside so I'm toooo lazy to do all that stuff. 

I can assure you that it's working and it seems to work correctly.

Thank you very much for you time evaluating my work!
